# HK Tech Platform Context

Context is loaded before agent execution and influences reasoning and behavior.
This platform is a distributed AI system with strict cost controls and audit needs.

Platform principles:
- Safety first: no secrets exposed in public APIs
- Auditability: all runtime actions are observable
- Cost control: token and budget limits enforced at VPS layer
- Reliability: non-destructive refactors only
